# recordmydesktop 2.0 - r2d2.sh

A better tool than
[recordmydesktop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RecordMyDesktop) for creating
screencasts from Archlinux (typically) to HTML5 video using .webm (For Firefox)
and .mp4 (H264) for Apple.

Usage: r2d2.sh [options] [output filename].webm

Options:

	-h this help
	-v verbose
	-m do not touch mixer
	-n do not create non-free mp4 for Apple devices
	-d duration in seconds
	-r just raw

Examples:

Records to $today/out.{webm,mp4} You need to enter [q] to finish the recording.

	r2d2.sh

Take a 5 second capture to 5seconds.webm

	r2d2.sh -d 5 -n 5seconds

# Config

My `~/.r2d2` configiration file looks like:

	dest=vids.webconverger.org:/srv/www/vids.webconverger.org

# Incorporating audio recording from another source like your iPhone & headphones mic

This is a good method requiring some careful synchronization to ensure clear
sound without the noise from your PC's microphone.

	r2d2.sh -r

whilst simultaneously hitting the red button of your voice recorder. q & enter
and stop the voice recorder at the same time.

The audio file in this example is `a.m4a` and to merge it in, use something
like:

	ffmpeg -i rawfYuV.mkv -i a.m4a -map 0:0 -map 1 -vcodec copy -acodec copy output.mkv

And now finish off the process with:

	./r2d2.sh output.mkv

# TODO - Great HTML5 video experience

* Tweak WebM content, good colours, try get duration fine
* Figure out how to get seeking working across browsers
* Figure out why webm is 2x the size of mp4
* Improve HTML output using `ffprobe` <http://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html#Writers>
* looking into `mkvmerge` from the mkvtoolnix-cli package for editing the raw

# Furthermore

* For Apple compatible MP4s, you need to ensure ffmpeg is compiled with [--enable-nonfree --enable-libfaac](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/27465)
* Thanks to ubitux, JEEB & [klaxa](https://gist.github.com/7dcccbd86fdcce3c4ced) on Freenode's #ffmpeg
